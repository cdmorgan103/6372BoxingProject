# 6372BoxingProject
6372 case study project with logistic regression and random forest models on boxing dataset

csv dataset included for ref as data.csv


dataset eliminates draws, data with unusual age values, and matches with missing fighter data. 

We likely will need to ignore the judge data since its not really a predictor... eliminating for now

will need to test power of stance/stance interaction as predictor, left NA values in for now
